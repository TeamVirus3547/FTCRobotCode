Team Code Conventions

Use camelCase for all variable/attribute and function/method names. This is first letter lowercase, 
the first letter of each word after that uppercase

Class, struct, enum names have Capital first letter

Every method or function must have at least one comment describing it's purpose and operation or logic.
Every name should have at least a passing relationship to the purpose for which it exists.

Whitespace is your friend, use it to make sure that your code is easily readable

Use uniform formatting. 

if/while/for code is formatted:

if(statement)
{
    //Four Spaces
}
else if(otherStatement)
{
    //Four Spaces
}

Do not do any of this formatting

if(statement) {
  //Tab
} else if() {
//No indent
}
else
     //One line of code

All of these are bad practice and will receive complaints from me. If tab is placed as the same distance as the spaces,
I don't really care. Just be neat and even.

Switch statements should be avoided wherever possible.
Do not use break.
